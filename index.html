    <h1>What We Know about Omicron</h1>
    pCDC has been collaborating with global public health and industry partners to learn about Omicron, as we continue
    to monitor its course. We donâ€™t yet know how easily it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, or how well
    available vaccines and medications work against it.
