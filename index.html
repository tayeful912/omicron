            <h2>Omicron in the United States</h2>
            <p>CDC is working with state and local public health officials to monitor the spread of Omicron. As of
                December
                20, 2021, Omicron has been detected in most states and territories and is rapidly increasing the
                proportion
                of COVID-19 cases it is causing.</p>

                to monitor its course. We don’t yet know how easily it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, or

                <h1 style="color: orangered;">Spread</h1>
                <h3>Severe Illness</h3>
                <p>The Omicron variant likely will spread more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and how easily
                    Omicron spreads compared to Delta remains unknown. CDC expects that anyone with Omicron infection
                    can
                    spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or don’t have symptoms.</p>

                <h1>Severe Illness</h1>
                <h3>The Omicron variant</h3>
                <p>More data are needed to know if Omicron infections, and especially reinfections and breakthrough
                    infections in people who are fully vaccinated, cause more severe illness or death than infection
                    with
                    other variants.</p>

                <h1>Vaccines</h1>
                <p>Current vaccines are expected to protect against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to
                    infection with the Omicron variant. However, breakthrough infections in people who are fully
                    vaccinated
                    are likely to occur. With other variants, like Delta, vaccines have remained effective at preventing
                    severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The recent emergence of Omicron further emphasizes the
                    importance of vaccination and boosters.</p>

                <h1>Treatments</h1>
                <p>Scientists are working to determine how well existing treatments for COVID-19 work. Based on the
                    changed
                    genetic make-up of Omicron, some treatments are likely to remain effective while others may be less
                    effective.
